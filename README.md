## Project Details
I have built a simple classifier using a pre-trained Mobile network V2  to classify 275 different species of birds. 
I have used Keras (an open source neural network library) to build this classifier. The model (bird_model.ipynb) contains a pre-trained Xception network.

I've got around <strong>96% accuracy</strong> in the Test set.
