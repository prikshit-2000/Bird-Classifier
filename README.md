# Bird-Classifier

## Overview

It is a simple classifier built using a pre-trained Mobile network V2  to classify 275 different species of birds.

## Project Details

I have used Keras (an open source neural network library) to build this classifier. The model (model.ipynb) contains a pre-trained Xception network.

I've got around <strong>98% accuracy</strong> in the Test set.
